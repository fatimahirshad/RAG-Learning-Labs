Assignment 1: Embeddings & Vector Databases

🎯 Objective
Hands-on practice with embeddings and vector databases as the foundation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

✅ Tasks Completed
1. Preprocessed a small set of sample documents.
2. Generated **sentence embeddings** using `SentenceTransformer`.
3. Stored embeddings in a **FAISS vector database**.
4. Implemented **document retrieval** (Top-k search).
5. Integrated retrieval results with a **baseline LLM** to build a simple **RAG pipeline**.
6. Tested with user queries to demonstrate retrieval + generation.
