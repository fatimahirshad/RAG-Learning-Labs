Assignment 1: Embeddings + Vector DB + RAG pipeline

🎯 Objective
Hands-on practice with embeddings and vector databases as the foundation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Build a small Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

✅ Tasks Completed
1. Collect ~20–30 documents
2. Generate embeddings (Sentence-BERT)
3. Store embeddings in FAISS
4. Retrieve top-k documents for a query
5. Use an LLM (OpenAI GPT if you supply a key, otherwise HF flan-t5-base) to answer using retrieved context
6. Demo with 5 queries and interactive queries

⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone this repo and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
