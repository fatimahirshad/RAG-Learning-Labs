# RAG-experiments-
A collection of practical work exploring embeddings, vector databases, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## ðŸ“Œ Repo Summary / Purpose
This repo is a hands-on collection of assignments exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and related NLP workflows.
It covers:

- Embeddings & vector databases (A1) â€” building a RAG pipeline.
- Evaluation of RAG systems (A2) â€” metrics, comparisons, and reflections.
- Advanced RAG techniques (A3) â€” MMR, hybrid retrieval, self-querying.
- Scaling RAG systems (A4) â€” vector stores, latency, and memory optimization.
- RAG vs fine-tuning (A5) â€” comparing adaptation strategies for LLMs.
- Prompt engineering in RAG (A6) â€” testing prompt design on performance and faithfulness.
  
Itâ€™s aimed at beginners to intermediate practitioners who want a step-by-step, hands-on exploration of RAG pipelines, evaluation, optimization, and advanced techniques.
